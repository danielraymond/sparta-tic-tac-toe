# sparta-tic-tac-toe

### Brief

1. Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2. Me and Joe added as contributors
3. Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4. pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5. The game should display the correct 'X' or 'O' for each button pressed in the browser
6. Once a tile has been clicked it should not be able to be clicked again
7. The clear button should clear the board
8. When a winning condition is present you should display a winner, either X or O
9. The program should use functions, loops, JQuery selectors and JQuery events.

### What went well:

I managed to set up some jquery events that would change the class of the elements and then a check to see what the class is.

### Difficulties

As mentioned I managed to change the class of the element when clicked on however when testing for the class of the element I think it says that the element contains the classes for both the X and the O. I don't know why this is.

### What I delivered

I delivered the git hub and readme deliverables. I did not complete any of the other deliverables because of the difficulties mentioned however I have a good idea of what I need to do to complete the other tasks but cannot progress past this point.
